# OOP

"""
 - OOP is paradigm, and a way to think and structure our code.
 - OOP is a way to structure out code, as it gets bigger, we are the able
    to keep it organized.
 -OOP allows us to create objects that have their own methods and attributes.
 - Python supports OOP
 - OOP applies the DRY principle
 - class
    - class uses CamelCase naming conviction
    - class naming should always be singular and not plural.
    - class is like a blueprint, where I can create other objects (instances).
    - class can be instantiated to create other instances. When somebody
      says: "Hey I just instantiated a class". It means he or she has created
      a new object of a class.
    - class is stored in memory.
    - objects instantiated from a class, searches memory for that class and run
      it.
    - __init__(self):
        - __init__ is a dunder method.
        - self refers to the class variable name (PlayerCharacter in example #2).
        - params following self in the __init__ dunder method are called attributes.
            - Attributes are pieces of data that are dynamic. When we instantiate an
            object, these attributes are going to be unique for that object (like
            name and age in our example).
            - Attribute are dynamic. We use self keyword to manipulate them.
            - In order to access attributes, we need to use self keyword.
            - class object attribute. Unlike attributes, class object attributes are
              static. We can't modify it, it's just all objects instantiated have
              access to it.
            - Class object attributes cannot be modified by instances.
            - We don't have to use self to access class object attribute, we could
              use the class it self.

    - The four pillars of OOP are:
        1. Encapsulation
            The binding of data and functions that manipulate that data. Like we
            encapsulate the class with its attributes and methods (data). For example
            I can create methods to use attributes defined. Here, I'm encapsulating
            the functionality. Also in strings methods, we encapsulate these methods
            to use with the string. like using .upper() with a string object.
