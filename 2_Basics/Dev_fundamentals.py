    Don't read from a dictionary!
     - Learn a language by focusing on what matters, Not by memorizing everything.
     - Search, google, and again don't memorize code.
     - Learn how to search for information.

Developer Fundamentals II
    Commenting our code

    - Comments makes could understandable.
    - Comments should be descriptive, and meaningful. Remember, others might read your code.
    - Comments should be briefed and short.

Developer Fundamentals III
    Which Data Structure should we be using? And when?
    - That really depends on what the problem is and what it really needs.

Developer Fundamentals IV
    What is good code?
    1. Code should be clean
        - Code should follow the Python standards.
        - Code should be well organized.
    2. Code should be readable
        - Other developer should understand your code when reading it.
    3. Code should be descriptive
        - Add comments before code explaining it.
    4. Code should be predictable.
        - Easy to understand.
    5. Don't repeat your code (DRY)
        - Implement functions making your code repeatable.
        - declare variable instead of repeating same lines of code over and over.

Developer Fundamental V
    Test your assumptions
     - Test your learning, do print(), play around with your code, and understand
       whats really happening behind the scene.

Developer Fundamental VI
    Pros and cons of libraries
    - We need to develop a skill to be able to distinguish between a good and a
      bad package, or resource demanding or light.
    - Import libraries that saves us time writing code.

Developer Fundamentals VII
