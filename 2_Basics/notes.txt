Data Types
 We need to understand data types in Python and how to manipulate them.
 Fundamental data types:
    int
    float
    str
    bool
    list
    set
    dict
    tuples

 Custom data types:
    classes

 specialized data types:
    modules and packages we use from libraries

 None
  None is the absence of value. Zero


- Any value above 0, is True in Python.  (print(bool(1))) => True
- Indentation in Python is mandatory
