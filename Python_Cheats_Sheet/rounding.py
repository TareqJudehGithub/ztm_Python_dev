'''Rounding in Python
 Round numerical values up and down in Python
When we round values, we go from a numerical value with decimal places to a whole number. With this process we do lose some precision, but the rounded value is often much easier to read and interpret.

Python has three ways to turn a floating-point value into a whole (integer) number:

The built-in round() function rounds values up and down.
The math.floor() function rounds down to the next full integer.
The math.ceil() function rounds up to the next full integer.

.2f  rounds to 2 decimals
print(format(10.541546, '.2f')) >>> 10.54
